The president of the Andalusian regional government, Juanma Moreno, has called the crash a "catastrophe".

"These kinds of accidents are surprising. The crash was very, very serious. A train carries society - grandparents, children, pregnant women... It's a catastrophe," he told Spanish news broadcaster, La Sexta.

At least 39 people have been killed and dozens more injured in the high-speed train collision in southern Spain.
